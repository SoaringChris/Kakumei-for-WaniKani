High Priority
- Subscription support!!! - can only show users subject data up to their subbed level
- Profile fragment - parse join date nicely
- Clean up WaniKaniServiceV2 interface - can get rid of similar endpoints
- Clean up gradle scripts (should also prob bump dependency versions)
- Firebase stuff
- Settings page cleanup (has config for recent unlocks/critical items/notifications)

Medium Priority
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab Adapters have a bunch of shared code - should be refactored, can prob extend from a base class
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab item RecyclerView fast scrolling
- Radical/Kanji/Vocab item RecyclerView hover over/long press highlighting
- Radicals, Kanji, and Vocabulary fragments prob have a limit on the number of items that will be displayed
    - Currently no pagination handling if too many items are returned from the api
- Better logging of api request calls - especially failure cases
- Existing bug - sometimes the LevelPicker will also select the user's level + 1
- Reduce number of API requests made When navigating from the Dashboard to the ProgressDetailsActivity (by clicking progress card)
- Better caching of user - we make too many api calls to get the user's current level (maybe attach user obj to sync intent)
- Clean up User stuff - made changes before WaniKaniAPIV1Interface created
- Notifications support
- Vacation Mode support
- Donations View currently just blank, do something with it (remove?)

Low Priority
- Google autoformat style/spacing
- Rate limit requests
- Caching of subjects - using updatedAfter queries to only get new data
- Recent Unlocks and Critical Items Views
- Tests (UT, IT)
- Java date objects instead of Strings in api models?
- Support back button navigation between main fragments (dashboard, radicals, kanji, vocab...)
- BaseItem methods - getKana() getOnyomi() getKunyomi() can prob be refactored
